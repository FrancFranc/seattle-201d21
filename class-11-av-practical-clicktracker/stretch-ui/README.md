# User Interface Stretch Assignment: Day 11 - Registration Page

This course is pretty heavily JavaScript-focused, meaning that HTML structure and CSS styling can easily fall by the wayside.
To help combat against that, we can make a habit of practicing building user interfaces daily, with just pure HTML and CSS.

**Note that these stretch assignments are EXTRA CREDIT, and are not mandatory.
As such, they won't be covered in code review or graded in great detail.**

## The Task

Presenting and handling a form is some basic work that is surprisingly complicated and challenging.
It's easy to visit a site and then complain about its user-input form, and a totally different thing to learn how to build a good one.

One of the first ways that a user will interact meaningfully with a website is through the registration/login page.
As a developer, you'll be building many of those (especially as a front-end developer), so it's good to get practice as early as possible.

Navigate to the [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) sign-in page and study their HTML structure and color scheme.
If you are already logged into Pinterest, log out or open up an [incognito window](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?source=gsearch&hl=en).
Don't worry about the images in the background.
Instead, leave the background black with an opacity of 0.5.

- Create a repository named `front-end-ui`, with a verbose `README.md` file and an appropriate open source `LICENSE`.
- Within the repository, create a directory called `day11-registration`. Do all your work for this assignment in that directory.
- Create a branch from `master` that is *also* called `day11-registration`
- **Give yourself no more than 1.5 hours of time and do your best to replicate the page, buttons and all. Submit the result even if you don't finish, just go with whatever you managed to build in that time.**
- Don't make the form functional, just replicate the UI to the best of your ability.
- Within the `README.md`, note your start time and your end time for your work on this assignment
- You may want to use an application to keep strict track of your time. [iCheckClock](http://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Mac-OS/iCheckClock-FREE.html) is a great application for Mac computers that serves this purpose.

## Submitting your work

When you're convinced your work is finished or your time is up, make a pull request from `day11-registration` to `master`.
Submit a link to that pull request to Canvas.

Along with your link, in the comment box write about any difficulties you faced in building the page, as well as any surprises that came up during its construction.

Feedback will be sparse and focused mostly on the design and user-friendliness, less on code.
